## Miscellaneous

-   Really important to be on top of scheduling and reaching out to the necessary individuals
-   Overwhelming at times, but being organized planning ahead really helps
-   Some issues/problems with teammates being AWOL or unresponsive, solution: check in with them either via email or Discord, confirm their participation
-   People will drop out, in some cases, may be able to merge some teams together if applicable and if possible
-   Even after deadline for QP applications, some people may still want to participate, if that’s the case, you can always add them to a team if possible (if space allows)
